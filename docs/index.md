# ACRONYM

Quality Control Tools for Quantitative Immunofluorescence Microscopy Data.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

ACRONYM is an interactive quality control pipeline for vetting and filtering low-quality single-cell data from multiplexed whole tissue and tissue microarray images. It comprises multiple modules for region of interest (ROI) selection, signal intensity and cell area cutoffs, cross-cycle cell correlation, cell clustering and visualization. Each step of the pipeline is a stand alone module. The pipeline is instantiated as a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class object, wherein partial results are cached for iterative and dynamic restarts.

ACRONYM development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/), Harvard Medical School.
