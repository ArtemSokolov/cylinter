# Cytolinter

Interactive Quality Control Software for Cleaning Microscopy-derived, Single-cell Data.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Cytolinter allows for the identification and filtration of cells impacted by optical and image preprocessing artifacts in multiplexed whole tissue and tissue microarray images. The tool comprises multiple modules that improve dataset quality by allowing the user to cross reference single-cell data with the microscopy images from which they were derived so this points can be censored from downstream analysis. The pipeline is instantiated as a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class whose module results are cached to allow for dynamic restarts and iterative quality control strategies.

Cytolinter development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/), Harvard Medical School.
